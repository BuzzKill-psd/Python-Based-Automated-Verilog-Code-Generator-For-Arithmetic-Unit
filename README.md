# Python-Based-Automated-Verilog-Code-Generator-For-Arithmetic-Unit
This Project has been done under prof. Joycee Mekie @ IIT Gandhinagar. The project contains tools to generate codes and implementation of arithmetic operations on a FPGA. 

Step 1: Open the command prompt and start the server by the command "python manage.py runserver".

Step 3: Choose any of the adder or divider or multiplier and give the number of bits and the name of the module as the input.
Step 4: Click on the button, the implementation of the generated code starts on the vivado. For this, the path of the vivado.bat file should be in the environment variables.
The PC running the software should have Vivado 2018 or above version installed. 
Step 5: Open the software teraterm and connect it to the basys 3 board.
Teraterm is used to give input to basys 3. The input is given in hexadecimal system. We can give 2 numbers of 64 bits as input in the teraterm.
